- title: Amazing guided tour of the southern night sky experience
  story: Chris set up while we waited inside, we then got to lie back on comfy reclining bean bags with hot water bottles and blankets while Chris took us on a guided tour of the southern night sky, from Alpha Centauri to Canopus, through the southern Cross to Scorpio and the Maui fish hook and off to Galaxies far away. From old red giants to new nebula. Using naked eyes, binoculars and an amazing telescope.

- title: Best night in my back yard - EVER!
  story: This was one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a very long time. Sitting around a fire with friends, Chris took us on a journey around what I have clearly taken for granted for so many years. Seeing Saturn from my back yard was AMAZING.
