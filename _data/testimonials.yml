- story: Becky is a superb presenter, her passion for the sky is contagious, her knowledge inspirational and the content is easy to engage with. You don’t even realise how cold it is when you're viewing the night sky with Becky. An excellent evening activity for anyone with the added bonus of a laser! Thank you Becky for two great viewings, here’s to the next.
