We're so lucky to have such a talented and experienced astronomy guide move her family to the Wairarapa to set up this new and exciting business 'Under the Stars' inside the proposed new International Dark Sky Reserve in the Wairarapa.

Local hotels, tours and event organisers are engaging the Under the Stars team to provide whole new experiences and themes for their conferences, visitors and events. This will bring a whole new dimension to the visitor experience in the Wairarapa.
