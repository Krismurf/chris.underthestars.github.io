Taking inspiration from the beautiful night sky surrounding the Wairarapa, Peppers Parehua have created our Smoke'n' hot Peppers Pig Burger â€“ Using our house-made black brioche bun with white sesame seed as a nod to the sky above and a beautiful smokey pulled pork as a nod to the year of the pig, matched with a delightfully fruity Garage Project Hapi Daze Pacific Pale Ale. Our offering for this years WOAP is sure to be an event for all five senses.
