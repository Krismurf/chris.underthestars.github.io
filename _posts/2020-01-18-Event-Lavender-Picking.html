Last yearâ€™s event was such a success that we are combining forces again this year! so come along and bring your telescope, a torch, evening picnic and enjoy the view at Ranui Essentials Lavender Farm, just 10 minutes outside Martinborough.<br>
Becky Bateman with her team from Under The Stars (Wairarapa Emerging Business Awards winner 2019) will help you navigate the stars. Watch the sun set and pick some lavender ($5 bunch). Lavender Shop on site.
