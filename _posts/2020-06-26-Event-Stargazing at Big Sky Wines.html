The stars align with two award winning businesses – Under the Stars and Big Sky Wines- joining forces to create an unforgettable evening.

Enjoy a Big Sky Wines tasting flight and nibbles, while being guided around the skies by astronomy tour guide Becky, all surrounded by the Big Sky vineyards and the stunning sky they are named after.

Becky will show you around the night sky through stories and science, take in close up views of the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn and nearby galaxies. You will understand why the sky was important to mark time and the seasons, but also plenty of time to discuss aliens, black holes, Pluto or anything else you’ve been wondering about.

Join us for a perfect Martinborough night out!
