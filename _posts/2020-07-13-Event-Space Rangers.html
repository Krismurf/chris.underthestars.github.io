A spacetastic school holiday workshop for school-aged children and their favourite adult.

Under The Stars is passionate about getting families to have fun learning about Space together.

So, kids, bring your favourite adult for 90 minutes of teamwork, creativity and Solar System fun and games these school holidays. Find out about planets, moons, the galaxy, our Sun, rockets and so much more!

Primary school-aged children are classed as 5yrs - 12yrs

This is not a drop off workshop, adults and kids will be working together over the session.
