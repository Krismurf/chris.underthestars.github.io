Come to the enchanted forest at Fareham House where you can look, listen, and learn about the stars from professional Stargazer -- Under the Stars' Becky Bateman!
This family friendly event is weather permitting (raincheck day: Thursday) and is free of charge, but you are welcome to make a small koha to the Dark Sky Society project in Wairarapa.
