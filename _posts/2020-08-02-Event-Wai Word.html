OPEN MIC
With Wairarapa on the verge of becoming a dark sky reserve, Wairarapa Word calls for stories / poems / songs on the theme of DARK SKY.
We have also invited astronomy consultant and guide Becky Bateman of Under the Stars to give a short talk on the day.
All welcome.
Free / Koha.
Wai Word - since 2012 - offers presentations on the first Sunday afternoon of every month, at 3pm
(except January).
Supported by Koha, Almo's Books and Carterton Creative Communities.
