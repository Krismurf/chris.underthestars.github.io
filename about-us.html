					<h2>What is <em>Under the Stars?</em></h2>
					<p>
						Stargazing is a wonderful, accessible and low risk activity available all year round. Whether your guests know nothing, something or a lot about astronomy, everyone will enjoy it!
					</p>
					<p>We show guests around the heavens, explore celestial objects through telescopes and binoculars, tell stories, discuss scientifically and culturally relevant information and how to navigate using the stars. Every session is different and as the sky changes over the year, we change our presentation to suit.
					</p>
					<p>Link stargazing experiences with delicious food, drink or music, inside presentations with astrophotography images or simply let us wow your guests with the simple beauty of the night sky. We bring star charts and show everyone how to use it so the stargazing experience can carry on after the evening has finished.</p>
					<p>Events are costed by the hour, with a two-hour minimum (including pack up and pack down)</p>
					
					<h2>Astronomy in Schools</h2>
					<p>
						Whether you are looking for a stargazing guide for a special evening event or help planning and delivering sessions during the school day, we can help!
					</p>
					<p>
						Under The Stars is passionate about educating astronomy through all levels and as we are from a teaching background so we can help you think about content, lesson planning or providing one off experiences for your class.  School experiences are capped at 2 hrs long.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Private Star Parties</h2>
					
					<p>
						Enjoy the night sky from the comfort of your own back yard or holiday accommodation! We come to you and provide all equipment for you and your guests to discover the night sky. We guide you in comfort with blankets, hot water bottles and hot cocoa.
					</p>
					<p>
						All ages welcome and up to 10 people. Gift Vouchers can be bought as a perfect experience for those who have everything!
					</p>
					<p>
						We also welcome ideas for special anniversaries, weddings, birthdays or just a memorable holiday experience.
