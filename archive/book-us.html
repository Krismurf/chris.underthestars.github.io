            Under The Stars is an award winning nomadic stargazing service in
            the Wairarapa.
          </p>
          <p>
            We come to you, wherever you are in the region. We specialise in
            small intimate star party gatherings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our aim is to provide memorable stargazing experiences that
            inspires, educates and that people will want to recommend. We want
            to reconnect people with the night sky and continually promote the
            Dark Sky Movement within the Wairarapa.
          </p>
          <p>
            We bring everything you need for a night of stargazing, a huge
            portable telescope, binoculars, star charts and blankets to keep you
            warm as you look up. We explain what you can see, stars and
            constellations and the stories and science they can tell us.
            Depending on what objects are up that night, we take a closer look
            at the Moon, planets (if they are in the sky) and some nearby deep
            sky objects like nebulae, clusters and galaxies. We also use the sky
            to do some simple celestial navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose a tour for 60 minutes or 90 minutes and are for up to 10
            people. If you would like a longer tour or more people to come get
            in touch. We also have a special couple star party rate for those
            romantic evenings under the stars.
