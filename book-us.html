              Under The Stars is an award winning nomadic stargazing service in the Wairarapa.
            </h2>

            <p>
              We come to you, wherever you are in the region. We specialise in
              small intimate star party gatherings.  We operate in all the COVID-19 Traffic Light colours for people who are Fully Vaccinated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our aim is to provide memorable stargazing experiences that
              inspires, educates and that people will want to recommend. We want
              to reconnect people with the night sky and continually promote the
              Dark Sky Movement within the Wairarapa.
            </p>

            <p>
              We bring everything you need for a night of stargazing, a huge
              portable telescope, binoculars, star charts and blankets to keep you
              warm as you look up. We explain what you can see, stars and
              constellations and the stories and science they can tell us.
              Depending on what objects are up that night, we take a closer look
              at the Moon, planets (if they are in the sky) and some nearby deep
              sky objects like nebulae, clusters and galaxies. We also use the sky
              to do some simple celestial navigation.
