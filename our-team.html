                  <p>Chris has been fascinated by astronomy since he was 6 years old and his dad kept him up late to see Halley's comet through binoculars. That began a lifelong love of being under starry skies and imagining the possibilities of other worlds. In 2012 he started an obsession with astrophotography and as well as enjoying being able to shoot the stars from home in Martinborough, continues to travel to remote places in search of the perfect night landscape. Chris has been a stargazing tour guide for Dark Sky Project in Lake Tekapo and their team leader for astrophotography. He has recently moved back to his home region to take advantage of the amazing night skies around the Wairarapa.</p>

                  <p>Becky started Under The Stars in 2018 when she moved her family over to the Wairarapa to be under the Wairarapa's Dark Skies. She has a background in teaching, space outreach and loves science. She loves being out and about, creating new experiences and including the community in astronomy. She is a dedicated committee member of the Wairarapa Dark Sky Society, aiming to certify the area as a Dark Sky Reserve.</p>
                  <p>In 2022 Becky passed on the business of Under the Stars to Chris. She will remain involved in the Wairarapa astronomy community and be called on as an occasional tour guide.

                    When he's not at a library or pointing people to the stars he loves to play hockey, walk, run, bike and generally just being outdoors exploring our region.

                    His earliest astronomy memory was waiting up late to see Halley's Comet as a 4 year old, only to be denied by clouds! However, from then on he has always been looking at the stars, wondering what else he might spot.
