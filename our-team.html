              Stargazing is a wonderful, accessible and low risk activity available all year round. Whether your guests know nothing, something or a lot about astronomy, everyone will enjoy it!
            </p>
            <p>We show guests around the heavens, explore celestial objects through telescopes and binoculars, tell stories, discuss scientifically and culturally relevant information and how to navigate using the stars. Every session is different and as the sky changes over the year, we change our presentation to suit.
            </p>
            <p>Link stargazing experiences with delicious food, drink or music, inside presentations with astrophotography images or simply let us wow your guests with the simple beauty of the night sky. We bring star charts and show everyone how to use it so the stargazing experience can carry on after the evening has finished.</p>
            
            <p>Events are costed by the hour, with a two-hour minimum (including pack up and pack down)</p>

                  <p>Chris has been fascinated by astronomy since he was 6 years old and his dad kept him up late to see Halley's comet through binoculars. That began a lifelong love of being under starry skies and imagining the possibilities of other worlds. In 2012 he started an obsession with astrophotography and as well as enjoying being able to shoot the stars from home in Martinborough, continues to travel to remote places in search of the perfect night landscape. Chris has been a stargazing tour guide for Dark Sky Project in Lake Tekapo and their team leader for astrophotography. He has recently moved back to his home region to take advantage of the amazing night skies around the Wairarapa.</p>

                    His earliest astronomy memory was waiting up late to see Halley's Comet as a 4 year old, only to be denied by clouds! However, from then on he has always been looking at the stars, wondering what else he might spot.

                    He's had a keen interest in space for most of his life. Anytime there is a clear night sky, he's typically outside taking photos of all the Nebulae, Galaxies and other Deep Sky Objects that he can image. Astrophotography has also helped him learn a lot more about space and how it all works. "I like my late-night research of space, figuring out the history, present and future of the universe."
