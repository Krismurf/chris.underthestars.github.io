							Mike

					    </p>
					    <p>
							Brian Cox&#39;s series &#39;Star Gazing&#39; really got him fired up to learn more about our solar system and the universe beyond, so our own galaxy the Milky Way was a great place to start. His favouriteplanet is Neptune, loves spiral galaxies, the Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula and the view of Earth from space.</p>
						<p>
							Mike’s work background is in leadership and organisational development. He has a Masters Degree in Business Coaching, as well as Diplomas in Training &amp; Assessment, and Multi-Media Design. Right now, he’s in the final stages of a Ph.D. inexecutive coaching supervision.

							Charlotte
						</h2>
						<p>
							Gazing in wonder at the stars above is a regular part of life since moving to the Wairarapa five years ago.</p>
						<p>
							The dark sky project is something I am extremely passionate about and it is so exciting to be involved and be part of the Under the Stars team.</p>
						<p>
							I am passionate not only about learning more about the wonder of the sky above but also in protecting, educating, and inspiring people to realise this is so incredibly special and not something to be taken for granted. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have a starry project in mind, contact Charlotte on <a href="mailto:charlotte@underthestars.co.nz">charlotte@underthestars.co.nz.</a>
