							Gazing in wonder at the stars above is a regular part of life since moving to the Wairarapa five years ago.</p>
						<p>
							The dark sky project is something I am extremely passionate about and it is so exciting to be involved and be part of the Under the Stars team.</p>
						<p>
							She is passionate not only about learning more about the wonder of the sky above but also in protecting, educating, and inspiring people to realise this is so incredibly special and not something to be taken for granted.

						</p>
						<p>
