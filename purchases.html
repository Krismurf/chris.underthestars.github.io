							Would you like to purchase a Stargazing Experience as a gift?
						</p>
						<p>
							The best environmentally friendly present is a memorable experience. Treat a loved one to a special unique evening with an award-winning stargazing service.
						</p>
						<p>
							We come to your place, set up all equipment that we need to show off the night sky. Telescopes, binoculars, warm blankets and star charts all ensure you are warm, comfy and have ring side seats to  wonder and be blown away by what we show you.<br>
							We give you a bespoke tour of the heavens; as every night the sky is a little bit different. Enjoy learning about constellations and the stories that surround them, myths and legends from MƒÅori folklore and practice navigating by the stars.
						</p>
						<p>	
							Depending on the night you choose and what is available, we look at celestial planets, the Moon, nearby galaxies and other beautiful Milky Way objects through the telescope. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Take the time to wonder at the night sky, reconnect to nature, reset your circadian rhythms (perfect for a good night sleep afterwards!) and understand why and how you can make the Wairarapa the next Dark Sky Reserve.
							
						</p>
						<p>
						    Gift Vouchers are for 90 minutes, a maximum 10 people and are valid for one year. We can post your Gift Voucher anywhere within New Zealand.
